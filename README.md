# weather-app

A simple one-page application that shows info such as weather information for a specific Japanese city.

The webpage is written in HTML, SCSS and jQuery.
In order to display City name, Weather forecast, Map and additional air-related information, I used 2 differrent API:
- openweathermap.org
- mapbox.com

I used Ajax to retrieve data from the APIs. I know I could also use PHP, but considering I can only understand it but not code with it, I prefered to use Javascript, which I'm also very comfortable with.

The webpage is fully responsive. Since I wasn't given any design nor styleguides, I followed my own creativity.
Upon inserting the postcode, a script will make sure it's in the japanese format and throws an error if it's not.
Upon success, all the relevant information about the postcode inserted are requested, retrieved, processed and injected in the HTML template.

Considering I'm following online Japanese courses in the morning, in total I spent around 10 hours on this project.

I really had fun doing this project and I hope you too will appreciate my little webapp!
I will be waiting for your kind feedback.
Best Regards,
Olga
